This marks the beginning of the First Project from "theodinproject.com".
Before starting this is I have a basic knowledge of html. The project is about creating a structure of a 'recipe' website using my current knowledge of html.

The Project is completed took some help from google regarding git commands.
Ran into a few problems during the project. Accidentally deleted a whole commit and lost a page but was able to retreive data using a few commands thanks to stacksoverflow.com
The Project was not that difficult and I was able to complete in a few hours.

Looking forward to future ventures
